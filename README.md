## Description

Design a Line Follower Maze Robot using TI Robotics System Learning Kit. The goal of the project was to integrate the `line sensor` and the `bump sensor` to solve a maze that searches for a treasure. The project was a combinational lab with six modules: Module 6 for GPIO interface the line sensor, Module 10 for SysTick interrupts, Module 12 and 13 for bump sensor, motors and PWM control, and Module 13 for line follower building. To achieve the goal of the project, the robot should begin from the starting point on the platform, self-drive via the line, know how to find the right path to the treasure and how to back up for lost, and stop at the treasure spot.

## Requirements

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Interface with the IR reflectance module
  * [x] Read sampling data to local memory
  * [x] Separate into different sernarios to determine the line position
* [x] Control DC motor
  * [x] Able to drive robot forward, backward, left, right
  * [x] Drive motor based on sernarios
* [x] Control Bumper sensor
  * [x] Able to backup when hitting the wall
  * [x] Retrack and go back to the line if lost

The following **future improvement** features are implemented:
* [ ] Reduce the average time to reach the treasure (`<60second`)
  * [ ] Refine cornercases for better tracking and drive motor more quickly and efficiently.
  * [x] Speed up the robot through better algorithm and reduce delay time.

## Methodology
The first task was to test the reflectance of the sensor. By obtaining the sampling values read from memory, we can categorize the reflectance into nine cases to determine the line positions as shown in ***Table 1*** below.

| Cases  |      Position(x)      |
|:-------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| The robot stayed at the center | `-47` < x < `47` |
| Slightly off to the left | `-47` < x < `142` |
| Slightly off to the right | `47` < x < `142` |
| Off to the left | 47 <= x <= `142` |
| Off to the right | `142` < x <= `237` |
| Way off to the left | `-332` < x <= `-237` |
| Way off to the right | `237` <= x < `332` |
| Lost | Data == `0b11111111` && x == `0` |
| At the treasureâ€™s position | Data == `0x00000000` && x == `333`|

When the robot stayed at the center position, it should go forward until the next instruction came. If the robot was not at the center, it should fix its path back to the center. In addition, the robot should be able to handle corner cases such as when it hit the dead end of the line or being obstructed by surrounding object as shown in ***Figure 1*** below.
